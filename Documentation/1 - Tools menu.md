| Item | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Random BPM` | Picks a random BPM value for the project. | |
| `Write Current BPM&LPB to Master column` | Self-explanatory. Useful to keep the project on rails when dealing with BPM and LPB changes. | |
| `Effect Column CheatSheet Dialog` | A pop-up window containg all pattern commands available in Renoise. | See [1.3.1](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#131---effect-column-cheatsheet-dialog). |
| `Collapse/Uncollapse All Tracks` | Self-explanatory. | |
| `Pattern Doubler` | Doubles the current pattern size while also duplicating its contents accordingly (notes, commands, etc). | |
| `Pattern Halver` | Sets the pattern to 1/2 current size. Works *differently* from the native keybind `CTRL+F8`, as it *does not adapt pattern content* to fit the new length. Simply put: pattern length is changed to half, but notes/commands remain in place. | |

### 1.3.1 - Effect Column CheatSheet Dialog

Please note: the FX Column CheatSheet also features sliders for the Volume, Pan, Delay and EFX columns. Moving a slider places the correspondent value in the highlighted track/line in the sequencer. It is very effective for manually programming intricate modulations: pick an effect, move the slider, move to next line, and so on. It's also the perfect companion for Renoise newcomers who still haven't learned the most important commands.

| Item | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Debug` | Different plugin related utilities for debugging. Can be ignored by the average user. | |
| `Switch Plugin AutoSuspend OFF` | Quickly Enables/Disables the AutoSuspend function in Renoise. From the [user manual](https://tutorials.renoise.com/wiki/Plugin): "Auto Suspend: When enabled, Renoise will completely shut off the plugin when it is no longer producing sound. This is mainly done to reduce CPU usage." | |
| `Expose/Hide Selected Device Parameters in Mixer` | Display plugin parameters in the mixer as sliders. It's the default behavior for some native devices, such as the Compressor and Mixer EQ. | See [1.4.1](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#141---exposehide-selected-device-parameters-in-mixer). |

| `Hide Track DSP Devices for All Tracks` | | | 
| `Bypass/Enable All Devices on Track` | Self-explanatory. Useful to check pre/post processing. In other words, how the FX chain is affecting signals in a particular track. | |
| `Load AU/VST/VST3 Plugins Dialog` | A pop-up window to quickly load instrument plugins or add them as keyboard shortcuts. These plugin shortcuts can be found under the Keys tab in Renoise Preferences. | See [1.4.2](https://github.com/untilde/paketti-unofficial-manual/blob/main/Documentation/1%20-%20Tools%20menu.md#142---load-auvstvst3-plugins-dialog). |
