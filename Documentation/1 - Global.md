### 1.3.1 - Effect Column CheatSheet Dialog

Please note: the FX Column CheatSheet also features sliders for the Volume, Pan, Delay and EFX columns. Moving a slider places the correspondent value in the highlighted track/line in the sequencer. It is very effective for manually programming intricate modulations: pick an effect, move the slider, move to next line, and so on. It's also the perfect companion for Renoise newcomers who still haven't learned the most important commands.
