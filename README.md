# About
This is an unofficial manual for the Paketti Renoise tool, based on Release [20240609121053](https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/releases/tag/20240609121053).

Paketti is a multipurpose Renoise tool. Working like an expansion pack, it delivers hundreds of new functionalities to the DAW, ranging from quality of life improvements to new advanced features inspired by Schism Tracker, ModPlugTracker, Player Pro and many others. It also addresses multiple community requests from the Renoise Forum that were not yet considered by the developers. 

It is far too complex to sum up in just a few words. However, some notable changes include:

* Hundreds of new keybinds covering multiple areas of Renoise;
* Automatically build drum kits with macros for PitchBend, Glide Amount, Cutoff, Resonance, Overdrive, Parallel Compression, Cutoff LFO Frequency, Cutoff LFO Amount.
* Automatically load multiple samples into sequential instrument slots;
* Device parameter randomizer;
* Change default computer keyboard Velocity with midi mapping;
* Quick live resample (auto starts real time playback and resamples incoming audio);
* Quick switch autosuspend for plugins;
* Bypass all devices in selected track;
* Floating window to insert plugins or devices and add them as keybinds;
* Floating interactable FX column cheat sheet, including sliders to quickly write modulation in your sequences;
* Pattern doubler/halver (duplicates the pattern, and the automation);
* Color/highlight the selected track in pattern editor (with editmode);
* Dozens of shortcuts for pattern AND phrase editing;
* Impulse Tracker (.it) key commands (ALT-D, ALT-L, ALT-U, ALT-F, ALT-G, F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F8);
* Quickly add automation curves to pattern automation (fade ins/fade outs (linear or exponential), pitchbend/panning);
* Show/hide device parameters as sliders in the Mixer;
* Control selected sample loop start/endpoints with MIDI;
* Control Automation start / endSelection via Midi
* Control Sample Buffer start / endSelection
* And much much more!

An extensive list of additions is available at the official [Paketti GitHub page](https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/).
