# About
This is an unofficial manual for the Paketti Renoise tool, based on Release [20240609121053](https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/releases/tag/20240609121053).

Paketti is a Renoise tool packing hundreds of new additions, ranging from quality of life adjustments to entire new functionalities. Working like an expansion pack, it addresses multiple community requests that were not yet considered by the Renoise developers.

It is far too complex to sum up in just a few words. However, some of the changes include:

* Quickly add Sampler modulations with a dropdown menu: Envelope, LFO, Stepper, etc;
* Auto add pitch bend macros for instruments/drum kits;
* Change default computer keyboard Velocity;
* Quick live resample (auto starts real time playback and resamples incoming audio);
* Switch autosuspend for all plugins;
* Bypass all devices in tracks;
* Floating window to add native devices;
* Floating interactable FX column cheat sheet;
* Pattern doubler/halver;
* Color/highlight the selected track in pattern editor;
* Dozens of shortcuts for pattern AND phrase editing, resizing and duplication;
* Impulse Tracker (.it) key commands;
* Quickly add Gainer automation curves (fade ins/fade outs);
* AU/VST/VST3/Native Plugins/Effects Lister;
* Show device/plugin parameters as sliders in the Mixer;
* Control selected sample loop start/end with MIDI;
* Any much much more!

An extensive list of additions is available at the official [Paketti GitHub page](https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/).
