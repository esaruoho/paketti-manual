---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Impulse Tracker shortcuts have been renamed to reference `Impulse Tracker` for easier discoverability. 
No more guessing. 
Note: "Mixpaste" is still not working, i started work on it but somehow couldn't get it going, will hopefully look at that later

![](attachments/2024-06-16_Impulse_Tracker_Shortcuts.gif)


---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Effect Column writers (shortcuts) now either outputs to selected_row if no selection, or to the selection
their naming has been tweaked also for better discoverability

![](attachments/2024-06-16_efc.gif)


---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Been working a bunch on making Menu Entries better and more organized, here's Keyzones
![](attachments/2024-06-16_Screenshot_2024-06-16_at_15.51.23.png)


---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: "Wipe Song Retain Sample" now no longer errors if the Instrument you selected has no sample.

---
### 2024-06-16 - WIP Improvement: Instrument Box Menu Entries are better organized
![](attachments/2024-06-16_Screenshot_2024-06-16_at_15.56.29.png)

---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Wipe & Slice no longer shoots an error if there is no sample in the instrument.  - instead shows a status "No samples available in the selected instrument".

---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Wipe & Slice will tell you how many slices have been added to the instrument, and reference the sample name.
![](attachments/2024-06-16_Screenshot_2024-06-16_at_16.09.35.png)

---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Wipe & Slice will tell you when you've wiped all slices
![](attachments/2024-06-16_Screenshot_2024-06-16_at_16.12.28.png)

---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: LoopBlock "2nd binds" made available with matching naming convention to what Renoise provides
![](attachments/2024-06-16_Screenshot_2024-06-16_at_16.52.53.png)

---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Enable / Bypass EFX in Pattern now uses the right commands to bypass the first 8 effects, or enable the first 8 effects.
(Meaning: now compatible with Renoise 3)

![](attachments/2024-06-16_Screenshot_2024-06-16_at_16.56.27.png)

---
### 2024-06-16 - esaruoho

Backend Improvement: there's now a global function for giving a XML Preset and loading it directly to a plugin. which'll be useful in the future for loading XML content into active_preset_data for a plugin or a device.

---
### 2024-06-16 - Improvement: Whenever saving a script, or saving a song, or loading a new song, or creating a new song, or loading a sample, the view_preset1 would be forcibly shown. 
I've removed that since it benefits no-one - the viewport should stay the same no matter what

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement to ImpulseTracker `ALT-L *2` functionality. 
Now, if you are on Send or Master, and press ALT-L, it will select the content of the Send or Master track. when you press ALT-L again, it will select all of the pattern data (including sends + masters). instead of "only the tracks and not sends + masters".

![](attachments/2024-06-17_ALT-L_logic_improvement.gif)

---
### 2024-06-17 - Fixed: when using Pattern Doubler to double a 256 row pattern to 512 - and the pattern has automation, there used to be an error shot.
now no error is shot no more and the automation works as expected.

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement: Sample Navigator now has the "Mono to Stereo" & "Mono to Left, Right Blank" & "Mono to Right, Left Blank" entries
And they're sorted correctly
![](attachments/2024-06-17_Screenshot_2024-06-17_at_13.05.35.png)

---

![](attachments/2024-06-17_Screenshot_2024-06-17_at_13.41.12.png)

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement: Paketti PitchBend DrumKit Loader now correctly sets LoopMode + Sample Interpolation for each of the samples loaded into the drumkit.

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement: Bypass EFXs are now grouped together
![](attachments/2024-06-17_Screenshot_2024-06-17_at_13.57.12.png)

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement: had to switch from vb:switch for loop release to vb:checkbox -  - but now the preferences actually work properly. for loading samples and for slicing.

this Loop Release mode, coupled with Backward - means that whenever you let go of the playing slice, it will start playing backwards until the beginning of the sample is reached.
![](attachments/2024-06-17_Screenshot_2024-06-17_at_14.47.41.png)

---
### 2024-06-17 - Feature: "Jump to First Track in Next Group" & "Jump to First Track in Previous Group" - as requested by icasiino - 
pretty much does what it says on the tin - if there are no groups, then it doesn't do anything.
![](attachments/2024-06-17_jump_to_next_previous_track.gif)

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement: 24st_pitchbend, 36st_pitchbend, 48st_pitchbend, 64st_pitchbend, 96st_pitchbend loaders updated with macros set up
these init instruments were lagging behind from 12st_pitchbend which had all the goodies
![](attachments/2024-06-17_Screenshot_2024-06-17_at_22.51.58.png)

---
### 2024-06-17 - Improvement: Pattern Editor Cheat Sheet: added "0Yxx" (Maybe), "0Zxx" (Trigger Phrase) - tweaked order of effects so they match ["Effect Command Cheatsheet on Renoise Forum"](https://forum.renoise.com/t/effect-commands-cheat-sheet/45512) .. 
more tweaks incoming later (additional efx, grouping)

![](attachments/2024-06-17_Screenshot_2024-06-17_at_23.42.27.png)

[Effect Commands Cheatsheet (Renoise Forum post, printable PDF by someone else)](https://forum.renoise.com/t/effect-commands-cheat-sheet/45512)

---
### 2024-06-18 - Feature: Globally Enable / Disable Volume Column, Panning Column, Delay Column, Sample FX Column. Available in Global:Tools:Paketti..:Pattern Editor, and Pattern Editor:Paketti..:  menu entries, and also as shortcuts. 

these change the Column Visibility of all regular Tracks to On/Off (Toggle) or Set to Visible.

### 2024-06-18 - Improvement: Globally / Enable Visible Columns are now also visible on View -> Paketti.. -> Pattern Editor -> submenu
![](attachments/2024-06-18_Screenshot_2024-06-18_at_13.19.19.png)


---
### 2024-06-18 - Improvements: `Bypass all Effects on Channel` now shows status `Disabled all Track DSP Devices on Selected Channel`
`Enable all Effects on Channel` now shows status `Enabled all Track DSP Devices on Selected Channel`

Tweaked most Track DSP Device hiding shortcuts + menu entries to make mention of "External Editor"
and added `"All open External Editors for Track DSP & Sample FX Chain Devices have been closed."`  and `"No Track DSP or Sample FX Chain Device External Editors were open, did nothing."` for informing the user what is going on.

this show_status thing will need to be done for hundreds of functions so whenever you see one that doesn't tell you what it does, hit me up and i'll tweak it in. there's too many for it to be doable in one go.

### 2024-06-19 - Improvement: "Jump to First Track in Next Group" & "Jump to First Track in Previous Group" shortcuts added to Pattern Matrix -- as requested by icasiino

![](attachments/2024-06-19_groupjumper_pattern_matrix.gif)


---
### 2024-06-19 - Improvement: 12st, 24st, 36st, 48st, 64st, 96st + drumkit loaders / init instruments now correctly map Cutoff knob to Cutoff, instead of.. Volume.. ü´¢ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---
### 2024-06-19 - Improvement: added "Mono to Stereo, Mono to Left, Mono to Right" to Sample Mappings (=Keyzones) menu
![](attachments/2024-06-19_Screenshot_2024-06-19_at_23.25.34.png)


---
### 2024-06-20 - Improvement: "Mono to Stereo" "Mono to Left with Right Blank", "Mono to Right with Left Blank" now retain basenote and other key mapping settings, and are put into the same sample slot as previously (meaning instruments with multiple samples will retain their organization correctly).

---
### 2024-06-21 - Improvement: if 0G01 Loader is ON and you Wipe&Slice - new tracks are no longer created for slicecount (if you sliced a sample to 128 slices, you'd get 128 tracks) now you no longer need to protect yourself by disabling 0G01 Loader in order to wipe&slice and then re-enable 0G01 Loader -- the wipe&slicer just does the ad-hoc disable at the start of wiping&slicing, and then just re-enables it, if it was enabled. 
(this closes (https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/183)[https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/183] )

---
### 2024-06-21 - Feature: AppSelection GUI now includes method for setting three Smart Folders (for macOS use), instead of hardwiring them to /Users/esaruoho/Music/samples/LogicSmartFolder + /Users/esaruoho/Music/samples/LiveSmartFolder..
I've also removed `sox` usage for adjusting 32bit samples to 24bit samples, which is no longer needed since Logic Pro can handle 32bit wavefiles nowadays.

NOTE: if there are apps out there that can't handle 32bit wavefiles, please tell me which ones they are, so i can try them out and add "adjust to 16bit" "adjust to 24bit" next to the Smart Folder path buttons.

### 2024-06-21 - Improvement: If you try to save sample or samples to a Smart Folder that is not set - an error is shown on the status and the Smart Folder GUI opens up

![](attachments/2024-06-21_Screenshot_2024-06-21_at_15.29.54.png)

---
### 2024-06-21 - esaruoho

Feature: Create Identical Track.
if your track has X amount of Note Columns, Effect Columns, Panning, Delay, Volume, Sample FX Columns visible or the track is collapsed -- (or if none of these are visible or on), the "Create Identical Track" shortcut will create a Track that matches the track you were on.
closes https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/208

---
### 2024-06-21 - esaruoho

Feature: Randomize Selected Instrument (All) Plugin Parameters .. but since it randomizes each parameter, you might have a bad time if the synth sets itself to not play anything (outputs that you're not listening to, etc..)

---
### 2024-06-21 - esaruoho

Improvement: Randomize Selected Device Parameters now shows the name of the device that was randomized.

---
### 2024-06-21 - esaruoho

Feature: LADSPA/DSSI Device loader (shortcut + midimapper) GUI created. if you have Linux, please DM me and i'll send you a xrnx and please take some video + screenshots, i can't test how it works myself.
EDIT: there's apparently some noisy devices there that have a really long name (looking at you: 
```
721  Audio/Effects/LADSPA/lsp-plugins-ladspa.so:http://lsp-plug.in/plugins/ladspa/sc_mb_dyna_processor_stereo
```
fun. but shoot me some screenshots + video  so i can pick up the pieces. seems to work anyway.

---
### 2024-06-21 - esaruoho

Improvement: Gainer Exponential Curve Up, Gainer Exponential Curve Down now goes from 0.0dB to INF or from INF to 0.0dB - instead of to "12.5dB" - thus boosting the input signal by +12dB.
fixes (https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/171)[https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/171]

usecase: make a way to fade in a sound by adding a gainer device to the track and fading sound in or sound out.

Feature: Move Slice End Left/Right by +10/-10, +100/-100, Move Slice Start LeftRight by +10/-10 +100/-100:
this means that you can be in the slice itself, and adjust the slice visually with nudges.

### 2024-06-22 - esaruoho

Improvement: Wipe Slices (in Wipe&Slice suite of features) now will properly wipe all slices from the sample even if a slice was selected when you wipe slices. (it used to do nothing)

---
### 2024-06-22 - esaruoho

Improvement: If there are no apps configured in App Selection, the dialog does not forcibly open on every new song, Renoise start, etc. Just a show_status message instead:
```

Improvement: If currently selected instrument has no plugin, Randomize Devices & Plugins dialog will still open.
If there are no plugins in the song, then Randomize All Plugins will show_status stating there are no plugins, instead of saying "yes, randomized all plugins in song". and in the same situation, "Show/Hide all Plugin External Editors" will also show a status.
and visual update: the fourth column now has empty space before the "Randomization intensity (%)" line to better line up.

---
### 2024-06-28 - esaruoho

Improvement: Note Interpolation now works on any note column on the track. same with selection. and.. if you have multiple note columns selected, and there's notes there at the start + end of pattern rows, the interpolation will happen. and if you have a selection within a track, the note interpolation will happen for the whole selection.

![](attachments/2024-06-28_alt-y_swap_block_improvements.gif)

---
### 2024-06-29 - esaruoho

Improvement: Transpose +12 / -12 / +1 / -1  so that if nothing is selected in the pattern, it will transpose the whole selected_track. if something is selected in the pattern, then it'll transpose the selection.
Feature: Transpose +12/-12/+1/-1 for selection, or just current note column.

both of these transposes actually go from C-9 to C-0 if you keep transposing.

---
### 2024-06-30 - esaruoho

Improvement: F5 "Impulse Tracker Play" used to have a 0.4 second delay after Panic + playback starting. it was to avert plugins from crashing (F5 is a macro that stops playback, runs Renoise Panic (to kill all audio) and then starts playback with follow pattern = on)) - now i cut it down to 0.225second, so it "feels less sluggish".

### 2024-07-05 - esaruoho

![](attachments/2024-07-05_Screenshot_2024-07-05_at_12.13.45.png)


---
### 2024-07-05 - esaruoho

Improvement: Solo Tracks will now:
- Work if the selected track is a Send - the rest of the Sends + Tracks are muted.
- Mute Sends if selected track is a Track, or if Selection In Pattern covers tracks.
- Work if Selected Track is within a Group - mutes the rest of the Tracks within the Group, but keeps the Group playing.
- If you Selection in Pattern say tracks4-5, and run shortcut, and then move Selection In Pattern to 5-6 and run shortcut, 5-6 will be unmuted and the rest muted. this used to mess up.
- Master is ignored and is not allowed to shoot error. (i.e. script no longer tries to mute Master for no reason.)

still ironing out 4 other issues, then it's ready. .. ü´¢

---
### 2024-07-05 - esaruoho

Improvement: the Smart Folders segment of this dialog has been, more understandably, modified to include "Backup Folders" and for the buttons to refer to "Folders" instead of "Smart Folders" - because the usecase is of course that you can set the folder of your choice to be a folder that's a smart folder (macOS) or any folder (such as a backup folder). think "folder 1 = drums, folder 2 = melodies, folder 3 = pads" or something like that

if anyone's into IRs, please DM me and I'll send a build and we can continue looking at this - i need plenty of IRs to make sure it all works

---
### 2024-07-08 - esaruoho

Improvement: There's now a connection between 0G01 loader and Paketti PitchBend Multiple Sample Loader - if 0G01 loader is set to On, then new tracks will be created per each loaded sample, and each track will cleanly have a instr automation device added, so there's no longer a flood of instr automation devices for the track you were on, i.e. you load 36 samples and there's 36 instr automation devices on selected_track.

- espeak path is stored  in Preferences
- settings stored in Preferences
- Sample Editor is brought up after rendering, so you can see what happened
- Can select whether new instrument is rendered or sample.
- User setting: every voice/language change will render a new sample / new instrument. (dropdownmenu & +/- changes for quickly changing the voice / language) -> means when you  hit +/- it'll render a new instrument every time.
- Languages sorted alphabetically

### 2024-07-18 - esaruoho

Feature: Resize & Fill. (available in Pattern Editor menu, Tools menu, and as a shortcut). this takes your pattern (and pattern automation) and expands until you have a pattern of 032, 064, 128, 256, 512 rows. so if you have a 4 row pattern, and you press "Resize & Fill 128" - the 4 row pattern changes to 128 rows, and the content is duplicated 32 times. 
if, however, you have a 512 row pattern and you press "resize&fill 032" - it will simply resize the pattern to 32 rows. and tell you accordingly.

this is basically a controlled "Paketti Pattern Doubler".

- now correctly shows the pattern effect command + effect description in show_status, and the GUI no longer says "0Axx" in button only to be followed by textfield starting with "0Axx - ". (no need to show redundant information twice)
- now writes properly to the selected effect columns and selected note columns - no matter where your cursor is. doing the note column + effect column math to figure out where to write. so your "not-selected" effect columns, and "not-selected note columns" are safe.
- the dialog sliders are in the correct places (aligned to the right, so the gui looks better)
- if you select a Group, Master or Send track, the Delay,Volume,Panning sliders no longer shoot errors.
- If you have Group, Master or Send tracks in Selection In Pattern, the Delay,Volume,Panning sliders no longer shoot errors.
- the cursor no longer jumps to the effect column, if you're on note column, instead writing to the effect column from the note column.
- if the selection_in_pattern does not have any effect columns selected, and you press a button for inputting an effect, the first effect column will be used.

### 2024-07-30 - esaruoho

Improvement: CheatSheet randomize functions improvements:
- Randomize Min/Max Only - if it is on, the randomize switches from min value and max value - so you can pick your favorite min value and max value and that will be the only content put to the selection in pattern, or whole track.
- Don't Overwrite - if this checkbox is On, the buttons you click during randomize will not overwrite currently existing effect content
- Fill All checkbox replaced with 0% to 100% Slider - Slider at 100% ? fill all. Slider at 10%? Fill Probability will be 10%.
- fixed ZTxx and Txx effects so the min + max are properly used, instead of erraneously introduced default values.

### 2024-08-07 - esaruoho

Feature: Paketti Midi Mappings dialog.
This shows all the Midi Mappings created by Paketti. if you also open the CMD-M Midi Mappings Dialog and enter the Extended mode, clicking on the button selects the Midi Mapping and you can press a button, twist a knob or move a slider to assign that. fastest way to onboard yourself into the features Paketti introduces.
I've also tweaked the namings of all the midimappings, and grouped them accordingly.

### 2024-08-08 - esaruoho

Feature: Paketti Clean Render Track or Group with LPB*2 

Ok, so what this does is pretty much identical to Paketti Clean Render - except.. right after it diskwrites, it writes current BPM + LPB to Master of current pattern
then it clones the pattern, increases LPB by *2 (so 4 -> 8), and writes BPM + LPB to Master of the new cloned pattern, which non-destructively replaces the original_pattern, and then puts in the sample onto the new track.

### 2024-08-09 - esaruoho

Feature: NumPad SelectPlay 0-8 now works with MidiMappings (single trigger, not double trigger). what this does is, you can play instrument slots 00 to 08 with pads. why is it called NumPad? Because there's also a version for NumPads. NOTE: this will NOT play the sample. it WILL however record to the pattern. if you have a quick pattern running, you can tap in beats and keep tapping in more beats. it will input a note to "current row". the note will always be C-4. while it is of course possible to fingerdrum a singular instrument's drums, this is for fingerdrumming instruments 00 to 08.

### 2024-08-09 - esaruoho

Improvement: Paketti Gater now has `LPB*2` and `LPB/2` buttons for `Clone Current Pattern and set LPB*2` and `Clone Current Pattern and set LPB/2`
what these do, is, print current LPB + BPM to current pattern.. then if you run `LPB*2` , it makes an identical copy of the same pattern, selects the new pattern, prints LPB*2 and BPM to the pattern.  LPB/2 does the LPB halving so LPB4 becomes 2.

Also, Print now writes to the amount of rows in the pattern, instead of only writing to 64 rows of the pattern.

---
### 2024-08-09 - esaruoho

Improvement: Paketti Gater now will output `L00` & `LC0` - in case you want to flip the mixer volume instead of sample volume.

### 2024-08-09 - esaruoho

---
### 2024-08-09 - esaruoho

Feature: OctaMED Pick/Put Dialog / Shortcuts / MidiMapping:
This lets you PICK a row to a slot (10 slots).. then you can move your cursor around and PUT it anywhere, to any track. the slots are saved.
there's editstep too. so you could pick, say, 10 very highly customized rows, and bang them in yourself with midi buttons or shortcuts, to any track.
it will resize the track to fit the max 12 note columns and max 8 effect columns, if they're in use.
you can also set it to selected instrument, so grab something that uses one instrument, and paste it somewhere else, using another instrument.

### 2024-09-04 - esaruoho

Improvement: Unison Generator now introduces randomized Panning (Hard Left / Hard Pan), and Finetuning happens randomly between -8 and 8 finetune values.

---
### 2024-09-04 - esaruoho

Feature: Chordsplus - this one is heavily in progress. Basically, you select a note on the first note column, and run either "add 1" to "add 12" - what it does is, print a note on the second note column that is pitched upwards by the number. so "add 3"? C-4 now has D#4 on the second note column. add 4? C-4 now has E-4 on the second note column. you can continue until you get to the 12th note column, after which, you'll be kicked back to the first note column but next row.

then, the same for sub to sub 12 - you have a C-4 on note column and run sub12? you now have C-3 on the next note column and that column is selected. this means you can quickly put together a chord with intervals.

but that's not all.

there are ready-made chords that you bang out with a shortcut (check second screenshot).
this means, you run the script while cursor is on a basenote -> result is a chord.

and the real deal is the midimapping. Global:Paketti:Chord Selector [0-127] <- this means you're on any row with a note on notecolumn1 -> twist a knob, and you've output an interval based on the note the cursor is under. meaning a large amount of possibilities of chords and variations.

note: this is very much a work in progress so if you're seeing intervals that are missing, send me a DM with the intervals (run them as "3-4-4-3" meaning 3rd transpose of basenote, 4th transpose of 2nd note, 4th transpose of 3rd note and 3rd transpose of 4th note.

I'm also introducing "Toggle Note Off to all Visible Note Columns on track" and a "Phrasing Randomizer" which takes the notes on your row and transposes them by 1, 2, 3 octaves up or down.

if you have any ideas, please get in touch.

### 2024-09-09 - esaruoho

Feature: "Set Repeater Value" MidiMapping. this takes a leaf from the `Show/Hide Slot` book, but instead of opening an external editor, one knob will 1. add Repeater if it is not already in Selected Track 2. change the parameters from parameterspace
```
Off, 1/1 Even, 1/1 Triplet, 1/1 Dotted, 1/2 Even, 1/2 Triplet, 1/2 Dotted, 1/4 Even, 1/4 Triplet, 1/4 Dotted, 1/8 Even, 1/8 Triplet, 1/8 Dotted, 1/16 Even, 1/16 Triplet, 1/16 Dotted, 1/32 Even, 1/32 Triplet, 1/32 Dotted, 1/64 Even, 1/64 Triplet, 1/64 Dotted, 1/128 Even, 1/128 Triplet, 1/128 Dotted
```
meaning, you tweak a knob and it changes to one of these. this is surprisingly powerful.
there's two flavors - one will rename the track destructively, so you know what's going on, the other will not rename the track.

### 2024-09-12 - esaruoho

Feature: Selected Device Automation Parameter 001-128 midimappings added. 
This means, you select a Device on TrackDSP, and twist a knob, and if it has a parameter in the knob you've set (001-128), that parameter will change, in the device, no automation. 
BUT if you have EditMode on, then the parameter value change is written to automation automatically to currentStep (not following playhead)
BUT if you have EditMode + Playing on, then the automation is written to playStep -> following playhead.

this means you will automate, with your battery of knobs or sliders, the value of any parameter in a selected device. - or if not recording, then simply change the parameter of any device.

Improvement: Coluga / YT-DLP now has a textfield for storing the location of the `yt-dlp` executable. This, along with the heavy plumbing i did, converting the bash script (which was macOS only, really) to full LUA, should allow yt-dlp to successfully download YouTube videos in full and add them as samples into a new instrument, complete with the Default XRNI Instrument (and it's macros) automatically added, on macOS, Linux and Windows.
It's been a long time in coming

### 2024-09-20 - esaruoho

Sidequest: In case you're wondering about the drop-off on updates on this channel, it's because I've been reworking the Sononymph tool so that it has more and better features, and improve the Configuration file detection. here's a screenshot or two. Sononymph is a tool that allows for a deep integration between Sononym and Renoise, and I've added certain features to it that "made sense" to have. If I include this in Paketti, I'll have to do a complete rewrite of it, so that it fits into how Paketti has been coded. I'm in contact with danoise about these features and hoping to see some, shall we say, official progress, further down the line. If he has abandoned it, I'll rewrite it and include it in Paketti.

### 2024-09-20 - esaruoho

Another sidequest: I've received permission from Martblek to take his "Simple Beat Detector" tool, which uses a lowpass filter to detect low-end beats and create slices, and modify it. I've been working on it, and now it has both lowpass and highpass filters for detecting beats, and therefore it now detects hihats too, not only bassdrums. It's still a work in progress, though - I want it to be better than the Renoise transient detection, before I will ship it in Paketti. Here's a rudimentary video.

---
### 2024-09-20 - esaruoho

Improvement: I've added three TouchOSC specific shortcuts, designed for switching to Pattern Editor, or to Sample Editor, and the third one starts sampling and stops it. So press a button and hold it down on TouchOSC - Renoise samples a new sample. Let go -> stops sampling.

### 2024-09-21 - esaruoho

Improvement: When loading a Plugin using a shortcut, the Middle Frame would change from "Midi tab" to "Sample tab" - mostly to Sample Editor. Added some logic to avert that, and also made sure that if you're in the Plugin Phrase Editor, you are no longer transported to Sample Phrase Editor.

Improvement: The "Selected Instrument Macros1-8" generation has been simplified so it is no longer so over-the-top.

Feature: Output Routing (Serial, Continual) & (Serial, Non-Continual) - this maps the Outputs for all tracks including master + sends. it is serial. continual will go through the list continually, non-continual will map as many outputs as you have, and the rest of the tracks will have the same output channel, if output channels have been exhausted.
there are "omit Master & include Master" flavors of each.

### 2024-10-01 - esaruoho

Feature: Clean Render Seamless Track/Group.. this will take your <256 row pattern, duplicate it to max 512 rows, i.e. play it "twice", then render it, select the first half of the sample, and add a loop from the end of the first half to the end of the second half. meaning, seamless loops with reverb tails.

---
### 2024-10-02 - esaruoho

Feature: Play at Random Line in Current Pattern, 2, 4 or LPB.
this will either, if follow pattern off, move the cursor to a random line in the pattern-space, or if set to 2, move to a matching.. or 4, move to a matching,  or LPB, move to a matching LPB space. so if you have 64 row pattern and LPB is 8, then it'll only randomize all the "8th" rows if that makes sense. also available for midimapping.
and if follow pattern is on, it will actually kick you to play the random line it picks. and no duplicate lines will be hit - so if you're already on row 48, pressing a randomizer will not accidentally kick you to row 48. enjoy (and remember to use autoseek! if you're working with loops)

This means you have one shortcut, that immediately creates a new instrument slot, selects it, writes onto it .. and injects the Macros, Paketti Loader default autofade, autoseek, oneshot, interpolation, mutegroup, new note action, oversample, beatsync, interpolation into it.
(but detail: you ***have*** to have "Create a new instrument on each take" off).  this way anything you sample using the function, will always be Pakettified.

### 2024-10-07 - esaruoho

Update: If you're wondering about the lack of updates, I've been working on a quite massive dialog + Dynamic View script which started around thursday-friday as (image1).. then changed to (image2).., and kept ballooning up until we're now at:
(Closes https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/379 & 
https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues/605)
it's still WIP so I'll describe it better, just an update so you know that it's coming and that's why it's been tumbleweed town on this channel.
(i was also on a trip to play a gig on friday and only returned last night at 9pm). there's updates coming, that's for sure.

### 2024-10-07 - esaruoho

Feature: Paketti Dynamic View Dialog + 8 Shortcuts. There's 4 Cycle slots per Dialog (1-4 Dialog & 5-8 Dialog).
This lets you fully configure a cycle-based shortcut (Dynamic View 01 to Dynamic View 08) with full control over Upper Frame, Middle Frame, Lower Frame and Visibility (Disk Browser, Instrument Box, Sample Recorder, Pattern Matrix, Pattern Advanced Edit). you can set up your own preferred shortcut for the controls. I believe this is the maximum control that the Renoise API allows for ViewModes, and they are dynamic, so you can set a maximum of 8 cycles, i.e. one shortcut will start from the first slot, then proceed to the next and next and next. 
there's also a system for saving and loading the presets. Enjoy.

### 2024-10-11 - esaruoho

Sidequest: In order to make it easier for me to "pick something to do" from the 120+ tickets on Paketti, I improved this script that picks a random ticket:

https://tobycm.github.io/random-issue-picker/?url=https://github.com/esaruoho/org.lackluster.Paketti.xrnx/issues&fetch

so running this resulted in me working on one long-standing ticket that i've been now tweaking for 1,5 days.

### 2024-10-11 - esaruoho

Update: I'm working on the same large new feature that i started yesterday morning and am hopefully gonna be able to finish it before Wednesday. Am making great progress with it. stay tuned. send a DM if interested in previews

---
### 2024-10-13 - esaruoho

Improvement: There's a theoretically-working-with API5 build Paketti (older version), which might work with Renoise v3.1.1. I don't have it available to me right now so can't check. it disables eSpeak, BeatDetector and removes all font styling.

---
### 2024-10-13 - esaruoho

Improvement: more alterations to API5 Older build, this should now evade certain errors encountered

---
### 2024-10-14 - esaruoho

Feature: Paketti Groovebox 8120. this is a 8 row groovebox, 16 steps per row. each step count can be modified between 1-16. it will, in realtime, output to the pattern editor. youcan load instruments into it using Browse - meaning, one instrument can have max 120 samples. so you can load 120 kicks, 120 snares, 120 hihats, 120 claps, 120 rimshots, 120 rides, 120 toms and 120 randompercs in, and use the Selection Slider or Random button to immediately change to one of them. there's also direct routing for automating pitchbend / cutoff / the Paketti Macro works. there's a Random Gate which will fill the 16 steps across all 8 rows in such a way that only one of the 8 instruments will be playde on that row. there's Global Groove controls. there's mute buttons for muting them. there's a Random Fill which will modify the Step counts and fill randomly. you can control bpm, play, follow pattern. when you move Select or Random slider, it shows the Sample Editor. when you click on Step-count of on Follow or Play, or a checkbox in the stepsequencer, it shows the pattern editor. when you click on Random Groove, or enable Global Groove, or Global Groove sliders, it shows you the Global groove. when you click on Show Automation, it shows you the automation.
Here's a little video demo of it:

I'm still improving on this, but this is the thing i've been working on for 3-4 days. Will keep cracking away at it until it does everything I want and when using it in a jam session type deal, i don't get any additional ideas. I'm open to any suggestions, out of interest, but let's please not blow this out of proportion by demanding lots of more rows etc.

Updates: I've merged the paketti manual work with the brickwall of text into one article instead of multiple pages. and wrote some more stuff to the brickwall and did the first rudiments of organizing it a bit better. i'll need to split it into little pieces and group them by themes and areas. It's a longform project, would probably take me a month to get it done fully and properly

---
### 2024-10-31 - esaruoho

Improvement: I've added 8 midiknobs that fit the 0...127 values into 1...8 for cycling through the Dynamic Views. if there's only two cycles configured for a dynamic view - then 0-64 will change to cycle1, and 65-127 to cycle2.
this means, you can configure a max of 8 different dynamic view states as per one Dynamic View number, and use one knob  to switch between these views.
so if you have a situation where you absolutely must quickly run from pattern editor to sample editor to sample editor with sample recorder showing to mixer to pattern editor with automation, to.. sample phrases.. to.. something - you can do it with the twist of a knob.

Feature: "Duplicate Pattern & Clear Muted Tracks" ->
you're on a pattern. you have a bunch of muted tracks. you maybe have some automation, and also some pattern matrix muted tracks.
you run the shortcut.
now, below the selected pattern, there's a newly created (and selected)  pattern, with the muted tracks(notes+automation) cleared, the pattern matrix mutes retained.  and if the pattern had a name, then the name is repeated, with `(mutes cleared)` added, and if the pattern had no name, then the name is printed as `pattern <number> (mutes cleared)`

### 2024-11-03 - esaruoho

Feature: Randomize Automation Parameter.
this is a global shortcut that will run anywhere, without needing you to focus automation just to randomize. if there's no envelope, it creates a new one. if there's a selection in envelope, it randomizes that. if you have pattern editor + automation displaying, and use `ALT-D *2` to select, you get to select an amount of automation rows and randomize that. at the end of the gif i use the Paketti loader shortcuts to shoot in some track dsp fx and then start automating them

### 2024-11-06 - esaruoho

Feature: added the AKWF waveforms to Paketti at +2 pitch and -35 finetune - there's loaders now that incorporate the default XRNI Instrument in the mix:
a random file will be selected, with the correct pitch and finetune, and loop mode enabled.
and you can stack them, i.e. load a max of 12 samples in and the volume will be reduced so it does not clip. same with "random 1...12" or just random 1. let me know if you need more changes and tweaks.

update: out of 7361 threads from 2002 to may 2024 - i picked 1736. i also started processing through which tool discussions / tool ideas / tool releases are worth looking into and either hijacking if they're abandoned, or rewriting with Paketti in mind.

also now that 7361->1736, i'll be working on sorting them into ~~three~~four distinct categories, aka
42. already done and in Paketti
43. not yet in Paketti, do
44. not yet in Paketti, could be done but very complex (further down the todo stream)
45. wait for API changes to allow the feature

same for Start Sampling and Sample Editor.

---

### 2025-01-14 - esaruoho

Improvement: I've resurrected the "Record to Current Track+Plus" feature and renamed it as `Paketti Overdub` . this allows, while Sample Recorder is set to these settings:
(sync start stop: Pattern, Create a new instrument set to OFF)
for recording max 12 new instruments per track, and auto-inputs the instrument at c-4 note and with 0G01 (glide) meaning you can record say 30 minutes of pads, and then have it play in your 16-64 row pattern (or any size pattern) and right at the end, restart the playback from the beginning. i.e. flawless loops.
i've got two more improvements for this on my todo-list, after which it's video-time.

---
### 2025-01-20 - Improvement: Unison Generator fixes.
- if you used the Unison Generator on a sample that's already been Unison Generator'd up, the panning was all wrong (not center, 50L, 50R, 50L, 50R, 50L, 50R, 50L - instead, all over the place)
- If you Unison Generator a Unison Generator'd sample, the naming used to go wrong. (think `New Sample 02 (Unison 7 [-2] (50R)) (Unison 7 [-2] (50L)) (Unison 7 [7] (50L))` etc and other such mess) - now, no longer.
Fixes https://github.com/esaruoho/paketti/issues/748

### 2025-01-22 - esaruoho

Improvement: Finally!! I've figured out the difference between Windows and macOS/Linux when it comes to Loading Paketti Presets. Windows now properly loads them when loading with "Paketti PitchBend Multiple Sample Loader" or "Paketti PitchBend DrumKit Loader".

---
### 2025-01-22 - esaruoho

Improvement: In light of the above - I've removed all of the custom code + user-definable XRNI preset code from Paketti Preferences.  since load_instrument doesn't work in the same way with windows / macOS - and nobody has volunteered any details of what kinds of 3rd party .XRNI instruments they use for this -- let's just keep it in a functional state by defaulting to the Paketti specified XRNI templates.

---
### 2025-02-16 - esaruoho

Am going through a ChangesLog I was maintaining and realized I've neglected to mention bunches of things I've done last year. Here's a catchup:

Feature: Set Quantization to 01...32 (Global, Pattern Editor, Phrase Editor)
![](Screenshots/quantization_set.png)

Feature: XLN Audio XO opener - checks where XO is in the track, VST,VST3,AudioUnit - if it is found, opens the External Editor. If not, loads it to a new instrument and opens. If already showing external editor, closes it. Reason for being? because you can alt-drag a selected drum into renoise (!!!) and load it.

Improvement: If "Replicate at Cursor All Above Current Track", and you're on the first row, then it defaults to repeating that low.

---
### 2025-02-16 - esaruoho
Continuing with the "Didn't I talk to anyone about this??" changeslog:
The **Paketti Stacker**.
This loads a sample, then lets you divide it mathematically into slices, then stacks them into a new instrument with velocity controlling which slice is played, then you can output a rising ramp (first to last), downwards ramp (last to first), then random ramp (any hit). 

To make this more sensible, I've added "Expand + Flood Fill" & "Shrink + Flood Fill", Pitch Stepper controls (-24, -12, 0, +12, +24), and Instrument Pitching, Loop Modes to the Dialog.

This enables you to scretch valid loops into little pieces and have them tick tick tick tick through the pattern.
![](Screenshots/pakettiStacker.png)
Give it a try.

---
### 2025-07-10 - Feature: Paketti Enhanced Phrase Generator Dialog.
I've been toying with this and tweaking it slowly for a few months now.

This started with "Oh yay, v3.5 has a Phrase Script Editor", followed by "But I don't want to use it. Can I script the script?". This is basically a system for creating, and always-rendering, the Phrase Script Editor output, and having it play, without needing to look at the Phrase Script Editor. It lets you decide how long the sequence of notes is, how many notes there are, and which scale the notes conform to, and what the note order is. When you drag the Length and Note Count sliders, new sequences are randomly created, new note orders, etc. Volume Range controls the minimum and maximum Velocity. Octave Range is, for the range of Octaves covered. You can Randomize the Voicings, Randomize the Velocity, or Randomize All. You're able to control the Instrument Transposition, the Shuffle, Step Size and LPB. And access all the Steppers dialogs. The Status bar will show you what you created, and it will automatically start playing. Experiment and enjoy!

Here's what it looks like currently. 
![](Screenshots/enhanced_phrase_generator.png)

-------
### 2025-07-10 - Feature: Midi Input Octave Control
Shortcuts, Midi Mappings and Menu Entries.

---
### 2025-07-10 - Improvement: Paketti Enhanced Phrase Generator
Uses the same Paketti Steppers code, so they stay in sync visually (I make a change to Paketti Steppers dialog, and the Phrase Generator dialog updates, too).
Pressing Duplicate will now both duplicate the instrument, and create a new track, and arm the track for playback, AND set "Always Render"&"Play Until End" to ON - meaning you immediately hear the changes you make.
When hitting the Instrument transpose buttons, the C-4 + 0G01 is printed to the selected Track in Pattern Editor.

![](Screenshots/deviceparameter.png)

----
### 2025-07-14 - Experimental Feature: Paketti Single Cycle Waveform Writer
There's a dropdown menu with multiple waveforms - there's a randomizer for creating random waveforms, you can have Wave A and Wave B and crossfade between them, there's a Hex Editor there so you can input the code in yourself. You can save a .CSV and load a .CSV - you can drag in a .CSV into Renoise and it'll get loaded. There's a "Create 12 random instrument" -> meaning, an instrument will pop up with 12 randomized waveforms pre-loaded, and Pakettified. There's the usual simplistic Sample Tools, Invert, Normalize, Fade In, Fade Out, Reverse, Scale 150% Scale 50%. You can pick up the waveform on your current Selected Sample - or have a Live Pickup Mode - which means, whichever Selected Sample you pick, the minute you draw, it is beamed back to the Sample. And a few other things. Any ideas welcome.

---
### 2025-07-28 - Improvement: Paketti Unison Generator now has a small amount of settings on the Paketti Preferences dialog
For setting the maximum minimum detune, and whether the detune fluctuates, or whether it's "hard sync" (surely the wrong term - but meaning if you set the finetune slider to 96, then all unison'd up samples are -96 to 96. And the original sample finetune is taken into consideration and calculated against.

---
### 2025-07-28 - Improvement: Paketti Single Cycle Wave Writer
Will now halt "Live Pickup Mode" for the duration of "Morph Sample" generation and "Export Wavetable to Instrument", to evade overwriting.

---
### 2025-07-31 - Improvement: Unison Generator Settings: "Duplicate Instrument before Unison processing" as a On/Off in Paketti Preferences.
Benefits: If set to True, and, you have a Plugin on the Instrument, the Plugin is duplicated. If set to True, and you have a bunch of Stepper settings or Volume AHDSR - the content is duplicated. If set to True, and you have the 8 macros set up already with user-preferred settings, all are retained.

---
### 2025-08-01 - Improvement: Delete Unused Samples had a regression where deleting unused samples would force a remap of the instrument, thus destroying the pattern. Now it doesn't delete the samples but instead overwrites the sample with silence (of 1 frame length, so minimum sample) and renames to EmptiedUnused.

---
### 2025-08-01 - Improvement: Fill Empty Sample Slots with Randomized drums will now take the EmptiedUnused into consideration, and make sure the drumkit mappings are not ruined while loading new samples in.

---
### 2025-08-01 - Improvement: Single Cycle Waveform Writer will now, when pressing Live Pickup Mode, on an empty instrument, auto-pitch+finetune the empty samplebuffer, so when you start drawing, you're already in 440Hz tune.

---
### 2025-08-01 - Feature: Experimental Render Sample
Highly experimental Render with tail - take your sample, run Experimental Render and the Macros, Selected Track TrackDSP and Sample FX Chain content is all rendered to the sample using a throwaway pattern - with extra silence padding added to the end of the sample so the tail is correctly rendered. The output is pakettified by default, so you're ready to go. Also compensates for headroom, and restores the headroom afterwards.

---
### 2025-08-02 - Improvement: Groovebox 8120 BPM button will now dynamically update if user is changing the BPM from within Renoise. And a tooltip.

![](Screenshots/gater_32steps.png)

---
### 2025-08-03 - Improvement: Single Cycle Waveform Writer
You can now use Single Cycle Waveform Writer to create "a type of wavetable" - The newly added "Write A&B" button will create Wave A as Sample Slot 1, Wave B as Sample Slot 2. The Wave A will be in Sample FX Chain 1, the Wave B will be in Sample FX Chain 2. The FX Chain 1 will have a LFO connected to Gainer, and the FX Chain 2 will also have a LFO connected to a Gainer. After the Gainer, for both FX Chains, there will be a Send device to FX Chain 3 - which is the "regular" Paketti FX Chain (followed by FX Chain 4 for Parallel Compression). After this, the Live Pickup Mode is enabled in the Single Cycle Waveform Writer - but with additional tweaks: Now, after this change, the Wave A Waveform drawing will write to Sample Slot 1, and Wave B Waveform drawing will write to Sample Slot 2. The Instrument is configured like so: The Modwheel controls the Reset of both LFO devices in Sample Chain 1 & Sample Chain 2. Both LFOs are set to "Infinite" Frequency - meaning, only the Modwheel will change the location of the LFO step. The Selected Track also gets a LFO, connected to Instr. Macro device's Modwheel. The Selected Track LFO Amplitude, Offset and Frequency, are exposed in the Mixer for easier availability, and the Dialog is automatically updated with three additional sliders - you guessed it, Amplitude, Offset and Frequency. This means that you can automate the LFO on the Selected Track - the device is helpfully renamed to `Wavetable Mod *LFO`, and thusly you can automate the crossfade / oscillation between the Wave A and Wave B waveforms. When the Single Cycle Waveform Writer is opened on an Instrument such as this - the Live Pickup Mode is automatically set, and the Three sliders on the Dialog are shown to the User.
Additional bonus: Since you now have a FX Chain for Wave A, and a FX Chain for Wave B, the Wave A Chain1 and Wave B Chain2 can have effects loaded in and there will be automatable crossfading between the actual Chain output (such as effects) of the Waves.

### 2025-08-05 - Feature: Paketti EQ30 Experiment
I‚Äôm a big fan of the age-old, 32-bit only, never-made-available for macOS, DiscoDSP EQ30. You can just draw with a mouse and get a bunch of sliders moved around. Hold the left mouse button down and paint ‚Üí a max of 30 EQ Bands are within your grasp with a single click + drag. So here‚Äôs a Renoise v3.5 only hack for making it happen, using 4 EQ10‚Äôs. If you have any ideas, do let me know. If you can think of other Renoise Native devices I could tweak and hack like this, do let me know, too.

### 2025-08-15 - Improvement: Paketti Stacker dialog no longer properly proceeded with stacking due to process slicing, fixed.

---
### 2025-08-15 - Improvement: Quick Load Devices Dialog now accepts up and down and enter to cycle through the results, and has fuzzy search for finding a result.

---
### 2025-08-15 - Improvement: Added a setting in Paketti Preferences so F8 (Impulse Tracker Stop Playback) will no longer disable (unless wanted) the Pattern Follow. Now there's Do Nothing, Enable, Disable, as settings.

---
### 2025-08-15 - Feature: Paketti Slab'o'Patterns - this dialog lets you create custom time signatures, and a section, if so inclined. There's a few presets.

102 SlideStatus
104 Tuning
```

---
### 2025-08-16 - Feature: Paketti Capture Last Take
This will let you have the dialog open, play notes on the Computer Keyboard, press enter and the played notes are saved as a chord, which you can then output anywhere. The Smart Note Off feature is also there, adding a Smart Note Off to the end of the pattern. And if you have 4 or 8 chords put to Dump Slots, then you can also spread them across the pattern. I can think of no method that would be as fast - and as dynamic. If you have a 512 row pattern, and have 8 chords, you can slam them in, automatically, without thinking, every 64 rows. 64 row and 4 chords? every 16 steps. If you made an error, you can always use backspace to remove the newest note, or shift-backspace to wipe the whole Currently Pressed Notes. You can modify the Slot Phrasing (shifting them by octaves randomly) or do the very same thing for the current Selected Track's Pattern content for Selected Pattern. And you can access the Paketti Gater directly.

---
### 2025-08-17 - Improvement: Impulse Tracker Move Forwards / Move Backwards by Track shortcuts would error out if trying to move from an Effect Column -containing track to a track that does have an Effect Column but it isn't visible. No longer. Fixed.

---
### 2025-08-17 - Improvement: Added "Audition" and a total of 16 slots to the Capture Last Take dialog. Audition lets you play the chord you played again, and click on it again to stop playing. Will let you find what you could play next by audition and then play and then create a new slot.
![](Screenshots/capturelasttake_audition.png)

---
### 2025-08-17 - Improvement: If Running Unison Generator on a Single Cycle Waveform Generator generated Wavetable sound, both Wave A & Wave B will be duplicated 5 times for a maximum of 12 samples, and Unison duplicates placed to the right Sample FX Chain, and the Wavetable LFO device will point to the Unison version.

---
### 2025-08-18 - Feature: Set Sample to End at End of Pattern
For those Reverse Cymbals - you can now have Paketti calculate the position + delay value for you, so you don't have to think about it. If there's something to tweak, tweak a bit. Enjoy!
![](Screenshots/riser_placer.png)

---
### 2025-08-18 - Improvement: Single Cycle Waveform Writer now has Unison A&B and Unison AKWF A&B writing - write a directly Unison Generated Wavetable and start automating the Crossfade between the two (and their unison copies)

---
### 2025-08-20 - Improvement: Single Cycle Waveform Writer: The H1-H11 data is written to the instrument + sample name, so thus re-opening the dialog will set the Harmonic Drawbars correctly and you can continue.

---
### 2025-08-20 - Feature: Midi Knob for cycling between Automation Envelopes that have content on them.
![](gif/midi_dynamic_automationswitch.gif)

---
### 2025-08-20 - Improvement: Hold-to-Fill will now follow EditStep - if selected, and can accept Midi Notes too. So, hold down a midi note with EditStep and it will fill the rest of the pattern. This is a slightly improved OctaMED feature.


---

### 2025-08-21 - Feature: Create New Sample Slot & Select  // Delete Selected Sample & Select. Create New Sample Slot will also use the Paketti Loader settings, so your preferred Autofade,Autoseek,Oversample,Interpolation settings will be applied.

---
### 2025-08-21 - Feature: Remove Empty Tracks - if the channel is empty across the whole pattern space, remove it. Also a flavor that only removes channels that are empty across the whole pattern space AND have no Track DSP effects.

---
### 2025-08-21 - Feature: Wipe all empty patterns from end of Pattern Sequencer. If you tend to create lots of empty patterns and then populate them - here's a method of safely deleting them.

![](Screenshots/8120_globgroovecheckbox.png)

---
### 2025-08-22 - Improvement: If you tried to use the Single Cycle Waveform Writer and write an A&B sample (A&B, A&B Unison, A&B AKWF, A&B AKWF Unison) on a Master, Send or Group Track - an error would be shot. Now you're protected from the error with an informative status message telling you to hit a regular track instead.

---
### 2025-08-22 - Improvement: Groovebox 8120: If you click on a Stepper button while the Paketti Steppers Dialog is open, the Dialog will no longer close, instead switch to that specific track.

---
### 2025-08-22 - Improvement: Groovebox 8120: SequentialRandomLoadAll, SequentialRandomLoad, Sequential Load buttons now all set the User Preference settings for Autofade, Oversample, Interpolation, Autoseek, etc at the end of loading all the (max 960) samples.

---
### 2025-08-23 - Feature: Polyend Slice Switcher - Detect imported PTI is in Slice instead of Beat Slice mode, and treat it as a C0-B9 instrument instead of loading it as Slices, set the Selected Slice as 00-7F velocity and the rest as 00-00 velocity and open, if Paketti Preferences set to it, a Slice Selector dialog that lets you set the preferred melodic Slice sample to 00-7F and the rest to 00-00 velocity.
![](Screenshots/polyendslice.png)

---
### 2025-08-24 - Improvement: Experimental Render will now 1) store and disable Loop Mode of a Sliced Sample during Render 2) reinstate Loop Mode to original Sliced sample 3) Strip Silence from the end of the Rendered sample (this is a setting in the Paketti Preferences).

---
### 2025-08-24 - Feature: Swap Pattern Slot with Above / Below - this will swap the content of the above pattern's selected track (note content / effects / automation) with the current pattern's selected track content. Same for Below.

---
### 2025-08-24 - Feature: Filename-Based Keyzone Mapping - so if your sample is, say, 01_69 to 01_79 - it'll map 00-69 and 79-119 (and everything in-between) to a keymapping setup. 
![](Screenshots/filenamebased_keyzone_mapping.png)

---
### 2025-08-25 - Improvement: Slices to Pattern will now adopt a more streamlined approach if BeatSync is set to On - and if there are very close slices (think flams) - multiple Note Columns will be used instead of overwriting the current Note Column row.

---
### 2025-08-25 - Feature: Squeeze Notes (Pattern) / (Song) - this will squeeze notes for a Selected Track, to the minimum available amount of Note Columns - so if you have notes all over the place on multiple Note Columns, they are moved.

---
### 2025-08-25 - Improvement: Explode Notes to New Tracks will now correctly sort the tracks (first first, last last), and there's a Paketti Preference for auto-naming the newly created tracks to note + instrument.name.

---
### 2025-08-25 - Feature: Send Selected Sample Region to User-Defined App - this lets you use the same Launch App feature to send a sample region to an app of your choice, or a folder of your choice. Same works already for Selected Sample, or for launching a specific app. This means you can send your samples to specific apps of your choice such as Ableton Live, Audacity, or any other app that can handle "app wav.wav" type loading (note well, Bitwig does not support this.)
![](Screenshots/launchappimprovements.png)

---
### 2025-08-25 - Improvement: Explode Notes to New Tracks will also explode the Effect Column, Delay, Panning, SampleFX Columns and if there are multiple same-notes on different effect columns with separate Sample FX / Delay / Panning / Velocity - then retain the note column count.
![](Screenshots/explodenotes_v4.png)

---
### 2025-08-25 - Improvement: "Fit Slices to Longer Slice with Power of 2 padding" is now protected against going for a larger slice count than the maximum 256 allowed.

---
### 2025-08-26 - Improvement: Groovebox 8120 now has a Collapse feature
![](Screenshots/8120_collapse.png)

So if you've got a track on-going, you can just slam the Groovebox 8120 onto it and continue on your merry way.

---
### 2025-08-26 - Feature: Clear Unused Patterns - this will clear all patterns that are not on the Pattern Sequence.

---
### 2025-08-26 - Feature: Paketti Fill - this Dialog allows you to fill the selection with certain content decided by you by modifying the Dialog settings.
![](Screenshots/pakettifill_better.png)


---

### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Paketti Fill now correctly maps the FromSample to ToSample sliders to Slices if there's a sliced sample - and the naming convention is Slice01 to SliceXX. The Min/Max Effect Column sliders are enabled by default, and are used when hitting any Effect from the Effect Dropdown Menu. Panning, Delay, Volume column writing has been enabled for Effect.. And Events is no longer auto-set to 50 when Step Length is, say, 4 - this used to require repetitive user intervention to fix the situation.

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Paketti Stacker "Follow Pattern" button will now move you to the Pattern Editor - if Follow Pattern is on, without toggling Follow Pattern off.

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Paketti Stacker the current Instrument Pitch Transpose will be read and the correct Pitch Switch in the dialog will be set (so if you're at +24 Transpose, then +24 Transpose button will be selected.)

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Paketti Stacker: When Stacking a Sliced sample, the original sample.name will be used in addition to "Slice 01" for better communication.

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Launch App Selection "Send Selected Sample" & "Send Selected Sample Region" now use a valid and informative filename. Such as `PERC WAV [2025-05-14 221922]_16beats_slice25-tmpSave.wav`

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Groovebox 8120's Global NNA "Cut" will now set _all_ Instrument Samples to "Cut".

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Single Cycle Waveform Writer will now correctly update the Harmonic Drawbars if we're dealing with a Harmonics sample.

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: MIDI Populator dialog will now inform you as to what specifically the rows / dropdowns are for.
![](Screenshots/midipop_header.png)

---
### 2025-08-27 - Improvement: Polyend Buddy: Save PTI + Save WAV + RX2->PTI will now correctly prompt for a place to save to, if device not connected and not on USB Storage Mode.

---
### 2025-08-27 - Load RingMod Instrument & Load RingMod Legacy Instrument - these are cheap and cheerful "starters" with keytracker going to RingMod (and DC Offset + Mono devices available but disabled, and parallel compression + cutoff/resonance macro knobs)
![](Screenshots/ringmod_placeholders.png)

---
### 2025-08-28 - Improvement: Paketti Steppers dialog will cleanly remove it's own notifiers by checking if they exist first before removing, instead of erroring out.

---
### 2025-08-28 - Improvement: Paketti Steppers Offset Slider will now reset to the middle when you let go, after moving the Offset of the selected Stepper.

---
### 2025-08-28 - Improvement: Paketti Groovebox 8120: Clicking on Automation on a different row will select the previously selected Automation envelope and create it from the macro knob state. But, if nothing is selected, then Pitchbend is created at 0.5 value.

---
### 2025-08-28 - Improvement: Paketti MIDI Populator will now correctly inject the correct type of Send device ("Keep Original" + "Send Volume at -INF")

---
### 2025-08-28 - Improvement: Paketti MIDI Populator now has a setting in Paketti Preferences for deciding if the Send or Multiband Send device is loaded when user requests Sends.

---
### 2025-08-28 - Improvement: Selected Track Dev (MIDI Mappings) will now 1) correctly expose the tweaked parameter on the Mixer, and, if device is not loaded, then load the device.

---
### 2025-08-29 - Improvement:  Polyend Buddy RX2->PTI button has been improved to also support REX & ITI - so it becomes a RX2/REX/ITI -> PTI button.

---
### 2025-08-29 - Improvement: CCizer: Added Polyend Performance Mode & Polyend Synth Mode textfiles for quickly setting up Midi Control Devices inside Renoise for automating or controlling these.

![](Screenshots/ccizer_polyend02.png)
![](Screenshots/ccizer_polyend03.png)

---
### 2025-08-29 - Improvement: Strip Silence & Move Beginning Silence to End now use Process Slicing so no further timeouts due to long processes.

---
### 2025-08-30 - Improvement: When the Parameter Editor is open, pressing space will open up the External Editor. Another space press will hide it.

---
### 2025-08-30 - Improvement: When Parameter Editor has closed in Automation Sync Mode, a new opening of a Parameter Editor would keep writing to Automation - now it correctly resets.

---
### 2025-08-30 - Improvement: Paketti Fill will no longer "not write", if EditStep is 0. Will also correctly update EditStep setting when in Notes mode. Will also clear the note column if typing Euclidian notes + effects. Will not clear Note Columns if typing "FX Only".

---

### 2025-08-31 - Improvement: Normalize Selected Sample / Slice
will now read the sample region selection and normalize only the selected channel selection, or, if nothing selected, the whole sample or slice.


---
### 2025-08-31 - Feature: Sample Effect Generator
This is a soft take / impression of the Anvil Studio: Audio Lab feature which allows you to draw a waveform, draw a pitch envelope and a volume envelope. Press enter, and you've got a sample.
![](Screenshots/pakettisampleeffectgenerator.png)

---
### 2025-09-01 - Improvement: Sample Effect Generator
Added more waveforms (2 octave steps, 1 octave steps), tweaked the 2X / 1/2X to be less buggy, improved the interface, added Invert button for inverting, added a Live Audition mode, so basically, draw and let go of drawing and it is rendered. Added Paketti Loader Settings (Interpolation, Oversampling, Autofade, other settings).. Added Random Steps for pitch loops, tweaked the Fade out to be less clicky. Also tunes the sample to a440hz so it'll, if using Octave Steps, for instance, match with a plugin played on the same instrument. Also added Process Slicing to the 25 Random samples, and made it less random (not random,random,random for 25 samples - instead, randomly pick something from the dropdown menus for Waveform, Pitch and Volume.)

---
### 2025-09-01 - Improvement: EQ30: Randomize by EditStep
This will clear the current EQ30 automation across all envelopes, and Randomize by EditStep - and set the envelopes to Points so they don't interpolate, but instead step by EditStep.

![](Screenshots/eq30randomizebyeditstep.png)

---
### 2025-09-01 - Improvement: Parameter Editor: Randomize by EditStep. 
This will clear the current Selected Device Automation Parameters, read EditStep and randomize Steps to all Parameters of the Device.

![](Screenshots/parametereditor_randomizebyeditstep.png)

---
### 2025-09-02 - Feature: 0C00 Note Cut Toggle
This shortcut will insert a Note Off 0C00 command to the selected Effect Column, or, if on Note Column, it'll appear on the first Effect Column.
![](gif/notecut_shortcut.gif)


---
### 2025-09-02 - Improvement: Paketti Theme Selector Save Favorites will save "onlynamewritten" as "onlynamewritten.xml" but if you save it as "textfile.txt" it'll save it as "textfile.txt". Just a minor improvement.

---
### 2025-09-02 - Feature: Paketti Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer
This allows you to pick your favorite 8 slices, or the 8 sample offset values of your choice, and start stepsequencing with them. There's also mute / pitch control for each slice - the pitch is disabled if you hit Sample Offset. And re-enabled when you move back to Slice. It will flood the pattern full (so 16 steps? 512 row pattern? Fills it all). Also you can offset, just like with Paketti Gater + Paketti Groovebox 8120 + Paketti VolDelayPan - them so they keep going against eachother causing all kinds of polyrhythmic fun.
![](Screenshots/sampleoffset_slice_stepseq.png)

---
### 2025-09-02 - Improvement: 0C00 to All tracks, 0C00 to Master only (current row)

---

### 2025-09-03 - Improvement: Toggle Solo Tracks will now correctly unsolo the track even if it's within a Group.

---
### 2025-09-03 - Improvement: PlayerPro Transpose +12 -12 will now correctly transpose each and every note column in the selection.

---
### 2025-09-03 - Improvement: Paketti Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer
When going from 16 steps to 32 steps, duplicate the content instead of forcing the user to re-do it.
Switching from using Sample FX Column for ZZ04 for defining StepCount, to. using Note Column naming for defining StepCount.
Maximum Slice was off by one (C#4 to A#4? - allowed picking B-4 which did nothing), fixed.
Writing "16step or 32step view?" to first note column (32_32) would mean StepCount 32 and View 32 Steps upon Dialog opening
Changing tracks will update the Dialog to that track's settings.

---
### 2025-09-04 - Improvement: Added Themes: Red Hack V1, Red Console V1, Level10, Level11, Level11 Bright, Level12.

---
### 2025-09-04 - Improvement: Paketti Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer
Sample Editor will now show the Sample Offset you're modifying. Added +1 -1 Octave control for Sample Offset mode.

-----
### 2025-09-04 - Improvement: Paketti Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer
When opening the dialog with a non-sliced sample, default to Sample Offset. When opening the dialog with a sliced sample, default to Slice mode.

---
### 2025-09-04 - Improvement: Distribute Samples to Individual Sample FX Chains now also does the same thing for Slices.
![](Screenshots/split_slices_to_samplefxchains.png)

![](Screenshots/dynamicviews_detach.png)

---
### 2025-09-05 - Improvement: Slice detection is now dynamic instead of hardcoded to c-4 c#4 onwards - the correct 8 first slices are automatically mapped to the rows when opening Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer.

---
### 2025-09-05 - Improvement: Impulse Tracker ALT-L (select whole track) modification - Shift-ALT-L will only select the currently selected Note Column instead of all the Note Columns in the currently selected Track.

---
### 2025-09-06 - Feature: "Solo Tracks with Pattern Data" - if you're doing A/B comparisons while arranging a track, and don't want to manually mute the "0 pattern" content, just run it on the previous pattern sequencer pattern and then go to the "0 pattern" and unmute something, then use "Duplicate Pattern Above & Clear Muted Tracks" to keep soft-arranging.

---
### 2025-09-07 - Improvement: Paketti Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer
Selecting a row will now highlight that, just like with Groovebox 8120
Selecting a row, while on the Sample Editor, will show the Slice you've selected, so you can easily edit the length of it with other Paketti shortcuts
Selecting a row, while on the Sample Editor, while in Sample Offset mode, will dynamically show you where the Sample Offset starts the playback from.
Duplicate Pattern will duplicate the current pattern to a new one and continue playback from that.
Changing a pattern without changing the track, will result in the stepsequence being updated.
Show Velocity in an extra area of the dialog.
Velocity Draw 
![](Screenshots/slicestepseq_velocitydraw.png)

---
### 2025-09-08 - Improvement: YT-DLP will now work more stably with Linux - finding the right binary for yt-dlp instead of being hardcoded to macOS settings

---
### 2025-09-08 - Improvement: Paketti Function Search will now correctly launch Midi functions - instead of doing nothing.

---
### 2025-09-09 - Improvement: Added Paketti Preferences for hiding Parameter Editor content such as "Previous Track" / "Previous Device" / "Next Device" / "Next Track", A/B, Randomize, Automation Points, and for creating a 75% height version of the canvas and for half-size font.

---
### 2025-09-09 - Improvement: Same Half-size Font Parameter setting for EQ30

---

![](gif/pickmove.gif)

---
### 2025-09-15 - Improvement: Paketti Chebyshev Polynomial Shaper now has multiple sliders to control Harmonics 2-11, and more tweaks and optimizations.

![](Screenshots/chebyshev_impr01.png)

---
### 2025-09-15 - Improvement: The "Paketti Automation" Doofer tweak/Hack checks / re-loads, are now implemented into F5, F6 and F7 (and F6 has been created.) F5 is ImpulseTracker for "Play Song from the beginning", F6 is "Play Pattern" and F7 is "Play from Selected Row". This means that when you use these shortcuts, after triggering the Paketti Automation hack - you'll be able to keep automating the Global Groove, LPB, BPM, EditMode, Octave, EditStep, Recording, Selected Instrument Pitch, Selected Sample LoopLength, Pattern Length and Selected Phrase LPB.  It will not work during Renoise Rendering, unfortunately. So "Rolling Sampler" or Audio Loopback only.

---

![](Screenshots/linearkeyboard_fret.png)

---
### 2025-09-17 - Improvement: Place Slices Evenly to Pattern / Slice to Pattern - these will place the Slices so that 16 slices will be put  every 4 rows to a 64 row pattern, for instance.

---
### 2025-09-17 - Improvement: Added "Sample Offset / Slice Step Sequencer" to Paketti Gadgets submenu for Sample Editor, Pattern Editor and Mixer, and to Tools -> Paketti Gadgets.

---
### 2025-09-18 - Feature: Paketti StemSlicer
